          SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
        </h2>
        <p>
          The process of conceptualising, defining, designing, programming,
          documenting, testing, and problem-fixing that goes into building and
          maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components is
          known as software development. Program development is a process of
          developing and maintaining source code. Still, it also covers all that
          happens between the idea of the intended software and its ultimate
          manifestation, often in a planned and organised procedure
        </p>
